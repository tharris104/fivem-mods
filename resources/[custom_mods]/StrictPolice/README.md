# Strict Police
author: **nemesis104**<br>
version: **1.0**<br><br>

This fivem mod tries to simulate single player police and
adds more while using the built-in wanted system. The first 
two stars are also less enforcing now where the police cannot
shoot at the target unless being shot at. the closest chosen
ped using a police uniform model will attempt to arrest
the player.

## Violations
* cop sees you speeding in car
* cop sees you burnout
* cop sees you doing a wheelie (motorcycles only)
* cop sees you driving known stolen vehicle
* cop sees you driving a known wanted vehicle (evaded successfully)
* cop sees your tires off ground multiple times (vehicles, not motorcycles)

## TODO
* cop sees you hit objects with vehicle
* cop sees you run redlight (depends on ped car sitting at red light as you run through)
* non-vehicle vilations
* bank robbery
* gas station robbery
* altercations (all peds can report)
